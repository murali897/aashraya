### 🏠 **Terrace Waterproofing: Post-Installation Care Guide**  

To maintain the **durability and effectiveness** of your terrace’s waterproofing system, please follow these essential guidelines:  

#### 🔹 **1. Minimize Heavy Loads**  
🚫 Avoid placing **heavy furniture, construction materials, or bulky items** on the terrace. Excessive weight can **strain and damage the waterproofing membrane**.  

#### 🧹 **2. Keep the Terrace Clean**  
✅ **Dispose of waste properly**—use designated bins for garbage, food scraps, and debris.  
❌ **No sharp objects**—broken glass can puncture the waterproofing layer.  
🚭 **No smoking**—cigarette butts are a fire hazard and can degrade the surface.  
🥂 **No alcohol spills or glass shards**—these can stain and weaken the coating.  

#### 💦 **3. Regular Cleaning is Key**  
🧽 Sweep away **leaves, dirt, and standing water** regularly.  
💧 Moisture buildup can **weaken the waterproofing over time**—keep the surface dry.

#### 🚧 **5. Consult Before Making Any Changes**  
🔨 **Do not drill, nail, or install** fixtures without consulting professionals.  
⚠️ Unauthorized modifications can **compromise the waterproofing system**.  

#### 🚿 **6. Use Gentle Cleaning Products**  
⚠️ Avoid **strong acids, solvents, or abrasive cleaners**—they can **erode the waterproofing layer**.  
✅ Opt for **mild soap solutions** and soft cleaning tools.  

#### 🚨 **7. Report Any Issues Immediately**  
📢 Notice **cracks, bubbles, peeling, or leaks**?  
📞 Report them to **building management ASAP** to **prevent costly repairs**.
